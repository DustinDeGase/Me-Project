            <p class="font">This is something that potentially could be loaded as a web page. We'll see. I just downloaded this code editer. First time ever! <br />I'm going to try and use every tool i can remember in this first example of a web page... site..... i'm really not sure yet what it is. It's a web page for sure and should be soon comnbined with other files to become an actual site. That is the goal. is this live?</p>

            <p>Here we are at the end of the page. Here i'll pretend to wrap things up for this first sheet of my first web site. This entire sight will focus on the fam. It's a bit of a tribute to them and my actual career. I finally have founf something doable that is worthy of a career. Should i put a list on here? Nah. </p>
            <p>I'll include some list and things via a link to another page. I think i need at leat four different pages to call it a website. You need to be able to navigate around to different pages to gain different information. ok. turd.</p>
