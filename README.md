# Me-Project
This is my first project and the first code I've ever wtitten.
I used Brackets Code Editor to write my first HTML5 with CSS. 
It's a work in progress and it's basically nothing more than a personal website.

It starts with <myindex.html> along with <myindex.css> as the home page. 
I know. I could have named the first file better. The rest are named better.
From <myindex.html>, it links to three other pages with links and such on each of them.
I included back and home links as well. That's about as fancy as it gets.
But, like I said, it is a work in progress and riddled with errors I am sure.
So. I guess that's it for now.
